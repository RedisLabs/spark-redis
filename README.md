# Spark-Redis
A library for reading and writing data from and to [Redis](http://redis.io) with [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/)

Spark-Redis provides access to all of Redis' data structures - String, Hash, List, Set and Sorted Set - from Spark as RDDs. It also supports reading/writing Dataframes and Spark SQL syntax.

The library can be used both with Redis stand-alone as well as clustered databases. When used with Redis cluster, Spark-Redis is aware of its partitioning scheme and adjusts in response to resharding and node failure events.

Spark-Redis also provides Spark-Streaming support.

## Version compatibility and branching

The library has several branches, each corresponds to a different supported Spark version. For example, 'branch-2.3' works with any Spark 2.3.x version.
The master branch contains the recent development for the next release.

| Spark-Redis | Spark         | Redis            | Supported Scala Versions | 
| ----------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| 2.3         | 2.3           | >=2.9.0          | 2.11                     | 
| 1.4         | 1.4           |                  | 2.10                     | 


## Known limitations

* Java, Python and R API bindings are not provided at this time

## Additional considerations
This library is work in progress so the API may change before the official release.
